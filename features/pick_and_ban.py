def pick_and_ban(config):
    """
    Continuously monitors the League of Legends champion select session and automates the pick and ban process.

    This function runs in an infinite loop, periodically checking the champion select session
    and automatically performing picks and bans based on the provided configuration.

    **Pick Logic:**
    1. **Lane Detection**: Determines the player's assigned lane (TOP, JUNGLE, MID, BOTTOM, UTILITY)
    2. **Teammate Tracking**: Collects all champions already picked/hovered by teammates to avoid conflicts
    3. **Counter-Pick Selection**: When it's the player's turn to pick:
        - Gathers enemy champions that have been picked or are being hovered
        - Retrieves the list of banned champions
        - Looks up the lane's pick configuration from config["picks"][LANE]
        - For each enemy champion, searches for counter-picks in the lane's config
        - Selects the first available champion that:
            * Exists in the champion ID mapping
            * Is not prepicked by teammates
            * Is not banned
            * Is not picked by enemies
        - Prioritizes counter-picks based on their position in enemy counter lists
        - Falls back to default picks if no counter-pick is available
    4. **Random Mode**: If random_mode_active is enabled, randomly selects from available default picks
    5. **Execution**: Attempts to pick the selected champion via API call

    **Ban Logic:**
    - When it's the player's turn to ban, attempts to ban the champion specified in config["bans"][LANE]
    - Provides success/failure feedback for ban attempts

    **Session Monitoring:**
    - Continuously polls the session every 4 seconds
    - Only processes actions during BAN_PICK or FINALIZATION phases
    - Handles session termination gracefully

    **Error Handling:**
    - Catches and logs exceptions during pick logic execution
    - Provides fallback behavior when champion availability checks fail
    - Gracefully handles API errors and invalid session states

    Args:
        config (dict): Configuration dictionary with the following structure:
            - picks (dict): Lane-specific pick configurations
                - LANE (str): Dictionary mapping champion names to counter lists
                - DEFAULT (dict): Default pick lists per lane
                - RANDOM_MODE (dict): Random pick lists per lane (if random_mode_active is True)
            - bans (dict): Lane-specific ban preferences
                - LANE (str): Champion name to ban for each lane
            - random_mode_active (bool, optional): Whether to use random selection for default picks

    Returns:
        None: This function runs indefinitely until interrupted or session ends
