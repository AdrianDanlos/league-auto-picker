    ---
    PICK LOGIC:
    1. The function periodically fetches the current champion select session and determines your assigned lane (e.g., TOP, JUNGLE, etc.).
    2. It collects all champion IDs that are already prepicked (hovered or locked in) by your teammates, so it will not attempt to pick these champions.
    3. When it is your turn to pick (i.e., your action is in progress and the phase is PICK): (CONFIG MATCHUPS FROM PATCH 15.14)
        a. It gathers the list of enemy champions that have already been picked or are being hovered.
        b. It looks up your lane's pick configuration from the config file (config["picks"][LANE]).
        c. For each enemy champion, it checks if there is a counter-pick list for that champion in your lane's config. It iterates through the counter-pick list in order, and selects the first champion that:
            - Is present in the champion ID map
            - Is NOT already prepicked by a teammate
        d. If multiple enemy champions have counter-picks available, the function prioritizes the champion that appears at the earliest index position across all counter lists. For example:
            - If enemy A has counter list ["Champ1", "Champ2", "Champ3"] and Champ2 is available (index 1)
            - If enemy B has counter list ["Champ4", "Champ1", "Champ5"] and Champ1 is available (index 1)
            - The function will pick Champ1 because it appears at index 1 in enemy B's list, which is earlier than Champ2 at index 1 in enemy A's list
        e. If a suitable counter-pick is found, it attempts to pick that champion.
        f. If no counter-pick is found for any enemy champion, it falls back to the default pick list for your lane (config["picks"]["DEFAULT"][LANE]). It iterates through the default picks in order, and selects the first champion that is available and not prepicked by a teammate.
        g. If a pick is successfully made (API returns 204), it prints a success message and stops further pick attempts for this round.
        h. If no suitable champion is found (all are prepicked or unavailable), it prints a failure message and does not pick.
    4. The process repeats every 4 seconds until the session ends or is interrupted.

    BAN LOGIC:
    - When it is your turn to ban, it attempts to ban the champion specified for your lane in config["bans"][LANE].
    - If the ban is successful, it prints a success message; otherwise, it prints a failure message.

    Args:
        base_url (str): The base URL for the League Client API.
        auth (tuple): Authentication tuple (username, password) for the API.
