   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On **Windows**:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

## Logging System

The application now includes a simple logging system that automatically redirects all console output to a log file. Here's how it works:

### Log Files

- **Location**: `logs/league_auto_picker.log`
- **Format**: Timestamped entries with format `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] message`
- **Content**: All console prints are automatically logged to this file

### Features

- ‚úÖ **Automatic Logging**: All `print()` statements are automatically logged
- ‚úÖ **Timestamped Entries**: Each log entry includes a timestamp
- ‚úÖ **Dual Output**: Logs appear both in console and log file
- ‚úÖ **Thread-Safe**: Works with multi-threaded operations
- ‚úÖ **Graceful Cleanup**: Properly closes log files on exit

### Testing the Logging System

You can test the logging functionality by running:

```
py test_logging.py
```

This will create sample log entries and show you how the system works.

## LP Tracking System

The application now includes an automatic LP tracking system that monitors your ranked progress.

### How It Works

- **Pre-Game**: Saves your current LP when champion select begins
- **Post-Game**: Updates LP data after the game ends
- **History**: Stores all LP changes in `lp_history.json`
- **Queue Support**: Tracks both Solo Queue and Flex Queue separately

### LP History File

- **Location**: `lp_history.json` (in project root)
- **Format**: JSON array of game records
- **Data**: Timestamp, queue type, pre/post LP, LP change, game result

## Last Game Analysis

The application now includes functionality to analyze your most recent game and extract key statistics.

### Features

- **Win/Loss Status**: Determines if you won or lost the game
- **Champion Information**: Shows which champion you played and their spells
- **KDA Statistics**: Provides kills, deaths, assists, and KDA ratio
- **Game Details**: Includes game duration, mode, and queue information

### Usage

```python
from features.lp_tracker import get_last_game_data

# Get last game analysis
result = get_last_game_data()

if "error" not in result:
    # Access the data
    win_loss = result["win_loss"]      # {"won": True, "result": "Victory"}
    champion = result["champion"]       # {"champion_name": "Yasuo", "champion_id": 157}
    kda = result["kda"]                # {"kills": 10, "deaths": 2, "assists": 5, "kda_display": "10/2/5"}

    print(f"Result: {win_loss['result']}")
    print(f"Champion: {champion['champion_name']}")
    print(f"KDA: {kda['kda_display']}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
```

### Testing

Run the test script to see the analysis in action:

```
python test_last_game.py
```

### Viewing LP History

You can view your LP history using the utility script:

```
py view_lp_history.py
```

This will show:

- Last 10 games with LP changes
- Total LP change across all tracked games
- Average LP change per game
- Game timestamps and queue types

### LP Tracking Features

- ‚úÖ **Automatic Tracking**: No manual input required
- ‚úÖ **Queue Detection**: Automatically detects Solo vs Flex queue
- ‚úÖ **Persistent Storage**: LP history survives program restarts
- ‚úÖ **Detailed Logging**: LP changes are logged to console and file
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles API errors and missing data

### Example Output

```
üìä Saved pre-game LP: 1250 (RANKED_SOLO_5x5)
üìä LP Change: +18 (1250 ‚Üí 1268)
```

### Testing LP Tracker
